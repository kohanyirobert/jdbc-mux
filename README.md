# jdbc-mux

[JDBC Connection] implementation that multiplexes two or more connections (see
the unit tests for some idea what this might do). 

## Notice

This repo was created to record some ideas only, nothing much will happen here
unless there'll be a need for this thing ... which shouldn't happen using proper
design patterns.
